# World Conquest

World Conquest is a turn-based strategy onchain game. Your mission? To conquer the world!

## How to play?
### Preparation Phase
At the beginning of the preparation phase, you will receive a certain number of troops depending on the number of players (3 players = 35 troops, 4 players = 30 troops, 5 players = 25 troops & 6 players = 20 troops).
Players take it in turns to deploy a troop in one of the 42 territories.
Once all the territories are occupied, you can deploy troops in the territories you own until you have none left, and then implement your strategy.

### Game Phase
The game phase of the player whose turn it is (the one with the name in the green box) consists of 3 stages: Reinforcements, Battle and Moving Troops.
#### Reinforcements
At the beginning of your turn you receive a number of reinforcement troops to be deployed depending on :
<br />• the number of territories you own: the number of reinforcements is equal to the number of territories divided by 3, with a minimum of 3 troops. (For example, if you own 14 territories, you will receive 14 / 3 = 4 troops).
<br />• the possession of 1 or more continents: Australia = 2 troops, South America = 2 troops, Africa = 3 troops, Europe = 5 troops, North America = 5 troops & Asia = 7 troops.
<br />• the exchange of bonus cards obtained when conquering territories. There are 3 types of bonus cards: infantry, cavalry and artillery. You can swap 1 of each, or 3 of the same card, for a reinforcement bonus.
If a player has 5 bonus cards at the start of its turn, he must exchange them.
The value of the bonus depends on the number of times it has been claimed:
<br />- 1st exchange: 4 bonus troops
<br />- 2nd exchange: 6 bonus troops
<br />- 3rd exchange: 8 bonus troops
<br />- 4th exchange: 10 bonus troops
<br />- 5th exchange: 12 bonus troops
<br />- 6th exchange: 15 bonus troops
<br />- 7th exchange: 20 bonus troops
<br />...and so on, each time increasing the number of troops by 5.

#### Battle
When the reinforcements are in place, the player can attack if he wishes. However, he must always leave at least 1 troop in any occupied territory. In other words, he can only attack from a territory occupied by at least 2 troops.
The player may only attack territories bordering the territory from which the attack originates. He must indicate how many troops he wishes to attack (maximum 3),
as well as the number of troops with which he intends to invade the territory in the event of victory.
<br /> The ruler of the territory under attack will then be asked how many troops he wishes to defend himself with (maximum 2).
<br />A roll of the dice is then made and the results compared, starting with the strongest on each side. For each comparison, if the defender's die result is equal to or higher than the attacker's, the attacker loses 1 troop. Otherwise, the defender loses 1 troop.
When the attacker destroys all the defender's troops in a territory, he occupies that territory with the invading troops. The player can immediately use this territory for a new attack and can carry out as many attacks as he wishes.
<br />If the player has conquered 1 or more territories during its turn, he will receive a bonus card at the end of its turn.

#### Moving Troops
Whether or not he has attacked during his turn, the player has the right to move troops from one territory to another bordering territory belonging to him. <br />
However, he can only make one move and, as after an attack, he must always leave 1 troop in his starting territory.

### Winning Condition
To win, a player must succeed in controlling all the territories.
